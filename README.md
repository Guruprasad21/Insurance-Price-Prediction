# Insurance-Price-Prediction

Objective was to create Regression model that will help predict the cost of the Insurance based on his/her BMI, Sex, Smoking habits, Age etc.,

Performed EDA and applied ML algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree regressor to predict the price. Explored Normalization and Feature transformation briefly. And tried to answer what would be the MSE with/without Normalization. How does a Decision Tree behave when the dataset contain large number of One Hot Encoded features.
